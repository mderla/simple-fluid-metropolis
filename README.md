# simple-fluid-metropolis
A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating drawing canonical ensemble distributed configurations for interacting fluids with Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation. From a programming point of view, it is plug-and-play with any isotropically interacting classical simple fluid, by setting the interaction potential u(r) to the desired one.
